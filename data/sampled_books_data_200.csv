2202607.0,"With the end of apartheid rule in South Africa and the ongoing economic crisis in Zimbabwe, the border between these Southern African countries has become one of the busiest inland ports of entry in the world. As border crossers wait for clearance, crime, violence, and illegal entries have become rampant. Francis Musoni observes that border jumping has become a way of life for many of those who live on both sides of the Limpopo River and he explores the reasons for this, including searches for better paying jobs and access to food and clothing at affordable prices. Musoni sets these actions into a framework of illegality. He considers how countries have failed to secure their borders, why passports are denied to travelers, and how border jumping has become a phenomenon with a long history, especially in Africa. Musoni emphasizes cross-border travelers' active participation in the making of this history and how clandestine mobility has presented opportunity and creative possibilities for those who are willing to take the risk.",253047153,9780253047151,en,2020-04-07 00:00:00,4.0,,Border Jumping and Migration Control in Southern Africa,FrancisMusoni,"African History | Migration, Immigration & Emigration | Human Geography",Paperback,francismusoni african history migration immigration emigration human geography with the end of apartheid rule in south africa and the ongoing economic crisis in zimbabwe the border between these southern african countries has become one of the busiest inland ports of entry in the world as border crossers wait for clearance crime violence and illegal entries have become rampant francis musoni observes that border jumping has become a way of life for many of those who live on both sides of the limpopo river and he explores the reasons for this including searches for better paying jobs and access to food and clothing at affordable prices musoni sets these actions into a framework of illegality he considers how countries have failed to secure their borders why passports are denied to travelers and how border jumping has become a phenomenon with a long history especially in africa musoni emphasizes crossborder travelers active participation in the making of this history and how clandestine mobility has presented opportunity and creative possibilities for those who are willing to take the risk

,"This book examines the question of why 'play' is a happy and benevolent verb in childhood, yet a subjective label of behaviour in adulthood. It studies the transformation of the positively labelled term 'child's play', used to refer to our early years, into an aberrance or deviation from normal social relationships in later life, when we speak of playing up or playing around. It answers the question by proposing play as a theory of learning, an ideology that circumscribes behaviour, and a way of thinking. Written by scholars of early childhood through to further and higher education, the book presents research on play enacted in a way that arches beyond the specificity of age groups or predictive, normative patterns. It is international in its focus, moving beyond insular, inward and parochial educational standards and limitations in one city, province, state or nation. Finally, it demonstrates the value of play to educational policy and theories of learning.",3319798073,9783319798073,en,2019-03-27 00:00:00,4.0,2.0,Play: A Theory of Learning and Change,TaraBrabazon,Philosophy | Social Research & Statistics | Child & Developmental Psychology | Cognition & Cognitive Psychology | Teaching Resources & Education | Teaching Resources & Education | Philosophy & Theory Of Education | Philosophy & Theory Of Education | Educational Psychology | Educational Psychology | Educational Strategies & Policy | Educational Strategies & Policy | Teaching Skills & Techniques | Teaching Skills & Techniques,Paperback,tarabrabazon philosophy social research statistics child developmental psychology cognition cognitive psychology teaching resources education teaching resources education philosophy theory of education philosophy theory of education educational psychology educational psychology educational strategies policy educational strategies policy teaching skills techniques teaching skills techniques this book examines the question of why play is a happy and benevolent verb in childhood yet a subjective label of behaviour in adulthood it studies the transformation of the positively labelled term childs play used to refer to our early years into an aberrance or deviation from normal social relationships in later life when we speak of playing up or playing around it answers the question by proposing play as a theory of learning an ideology that circumscribes behaviour and a way of thinking written by scholars of early childhood through to further and higher education the book presents research on play enacted in a way that arches beyond the specificity of age groups or predictive normative patterns it is international in its focus moving beyond insular inward and parochial educational standards and limitations in one city province state or nation finally it demonstrates the value of play to educational policy and theories of learning

However, conditions in the 21st century are so far removed from the state of affairs in the 1950s that, although the basic principle of the foundry remains the same, the language and the presentation of the book was due to be uplifted. This present edition therefore represents a complete rewrite to conform to the era and, in particular, to the availability of material which at one time was taken for granted.

829143.0,"Major Louis Joseph Vionnet's memoirs of Napoleon's disastrous 1812 campaign in Russia are readable, detailed, and full of personal anecdote and vivid glimpses into the life of the nineteenth-century soldier. His account concentrates in particular on the retreat from Moscow, but he was present at all the major actions and followed the entire course of the campaign from the opening moves in July 1812 to being chased through Prussia by bands of Cossacks in early 1813. He was present at the destruction of Smolensk, toured the battlefield of Borodino and witnessed the great fire in Moscow.

This is the journey of human consciousness  -  the story of an eternal, metamorphic process. As the author suggests, consciousness is not a self-contained, unchangeable faculty. The way we perceive the surrounding world today  -  with the potential for sophisticated and exact observation of natural phenomena  -  has evolved over thousands of years. What was once a blurred and fragmentary perception in the time of Ancient India has evolved to a clear awareness of everyday reality.  Using pictures as his starting point, Henk van Oort outlines a remarkable narrative, beginning with the age-old myth of Noah's Ark, in which a rainbow is presented to the survivors of the Biblical flood.

They are all people who see the world differently from their contemporaries and therefore seem absurd, like Pablo Picasso in ""Au Tombeau de Charles Fourier,"" Leonardo Da Vinci in ""The Richard Nixon Freischütz Rag,"" James Joyce and Guillaume Apollinaire in the marvelous ""The Haile Selassie Funeral Train."" Hilton Kramer of The New York Times has said, ""Davenport's conception of the short story form is remarkable.

From Darwin to Dawkins, extensive scientific evidence has been presented for evolution, yet almost half of contemporary society still isn't convinced. The Scientific Approach to Evolution provides a rational new perspective on this debate. Scientific evidence is not all created equally. Some forms of evidence provide only low confidence, while other forms of evidence provide high confidence. Rob Stadler describes a compelling approach to determine the level of confidence and applies it to the commonly cited evidence for evolution. When high-confidence evidence is appropriately prioritized over low-confidence evidence, the result is a profound new view of evolution-one that they did not teach you in biology.",1532988095,9781532988097,en,2016-09-14 00:00:00,4.04,26.0,The Scientific Approach to Evolution : What They Didn't Teach You in Biology,RobStadler,Evolution,Paperback,robstadler evolution for more than 150 years continuous debate has swirled around the topic of evolution from darwin to dawkins extensive scientific evidence has been presented for evolution yet almost half of contemporary society still isnt convinced the scientific approach to evolution provides a rational new perspective on this debate scientific evidence is not all created equally some forms of evidence provide only low confidence while other forms of evidence provide high confidence rob stadler describes a compelling approach to determine the level of confidence and applies it to the commonly cited evidence for evolution when highconfidence evidence is appropriately prioritized over lowconfidence evidence the result is a profound new view of evolutionone that they did not teach you in biology

719437.0,"This book is about having ideas and-a much longer haul-making them work. David Jones, best known for his  Daedalus column, tells many stories about creators and their creations, including his own fantastical-seeming contributions to mainstream science-such as unrideable bicycles and chemical gardens in space. His theory of creativity endows each of us with a Random-Ideas Generator, a Censor, and an Observer-Reasoner. Jones applies the theory to a wide range of weird scientific experiments that he has conducted for serious scientific papers, for challenging printed expositions, and for presentations to a TV audience. He even suggests new ones, not yet tried! Creativity is as essential to science as curiosity, physical intuition, and shrewd deduction from well-planned experiments. But, says Jones, ingenuity is very uncertain-even for the greatest inventors, about 80 percent of ideas fail. Jokiness can help, and so can lots of random data.

1620666.0,"By the beginning of the nineteenth century, over ninety-five percent of all the productive land in Ireland was in the hands of Anglo-Irish landowners. They lived in the 'big houses', some of which still exist today, resplendent within their walled estates. Many others are now only gaunt ruins silhouetted against somber Irish skies, victims of 'the troubles' in the 1920s. There is a continuing fascination with the history of the big house in Ireland. Much of this interest stems from the Anglo-Irish living in places apart, in their estates, often in remote areas of an undeveloped and hostile land. Part of the appeal is in the characters, neither wholly English nor Irish, who made up this landowning class in Ireland. However, another part, largely ignored until this study, is how many of these landowners not only met these challenges but achieved remarkable levels of self-sufficiency. It was their exploitation of technology that hugely bolstered their status and independence and enabled them to lead an exotic lifestyle in Ireland. Although much has been written regarding the social and political history of the Anglo-Irish in Ireland, little research has been conducted into the practical problems of living there. At a time when there were few roads, no railways, and sailing ships were the unreliable connection with England, existence might have been very basic indeed. Charles Carson uncovers and explains in simple terms the technologies employed, to not only make life bearable, but in some case to become a triumph over seemingly impossible odds. An appreciation of this background helps to explain the sense of status and independence that emanates from the big house in Ireland until their demise in the late twentieth century. Interdisciplinary investigative methods were used in this work. These included extensive archival research of estate papers throughout Ireland; fieldwork involving examination and photography of still-extant big house technology; and the use of published fictional and biographical big house material. Much additional insight, and suggestions for further research, resulted from visits to various big house locations. Owners, often descendants of the original families, or managers and ground staff, provided important local knowledge. Climbing amongst stored artefacts in cellars, barns, and subterranean tunnels helped to bring the past alive. Something of the ambiance of these explorations informs this book, thus helping towards an understanding of the fundamental importance of technology in underpinning the status and independence of the big house in Ireland. By examining the range, costs, and changing nature of the technologies employed, this book makes an important contribution to a deeper understanding of life in the big house in Ireland circa 1800 to circa 1930. Brief descriptions, accompanied by drawings or photographs, are employed to explain the operation, limitations, and improvements of many of the installations and techniques. These include water closets, pumps, cisterns, boilers, and firefighting equipment; open fires, hot air stoves, and central heating; walled gardens, hot walls and beds, warm air, steam, and hot water heating of glasshouses; the construction, location, stocking, and use of ice houses and ice; daylight enhancement, candle, oil, gas, and electric lighting; an optical telegraph, a church spire, engine driven equipment on the estate farm as well as mapping of bogs and their reclamation by wooden railways.

1037833.0,"Beneath Contempt is a raucous, heavily illustrated X-rated tale of the amazing life and publishing career of unrepentant porn king Al Goldstein. The self-made sultan of Times Square, he ruled over this mythic realm of sin and corruption for decades, chronicling its forbidden pleasures in the pages of his trailblazing sex paper Screw and making them accessible to millions. His story is the stuff of the American Dream. An overweight cab driver and welfare recipient who founded Screw and became the most outspoken figurehead of the sex revolution, Goldstein went on to become a multi-millionaire and tireless opponent of all things ""establishment."" Here was a man who had sex with the world's most famous porn starlets, rubbed elbows with literary lions such as Henry Miller and Phillip Roth, attended celebrity orgies with the likes of Gay Talese, partied with Hugh Hefner at the Playboy mansion and then lost it all, morphing into America's most famous homeless drifter of the new millennium. He threw his heart, soul and fortune into a series of bruising First Amendment battles and became a folk hero to the disgruntled masses, giving the finger to the world as ex-wives drained him and fired ex-employees and unwitting targets of his vicious satires who couldn't take a joke sued him. Cabbies, waiters and cops on the beat cheered him when he appeared on the street. The Al Goldstein story stars a cast of thousands of hookers, hustlers and porn starlets, with key guest parts played by equally colourful characters. In addition to getting up-close-and-personal to Goldstein in a way that lends heretofore unavailable detail and context to the story, Beneath Contempt charts Screw's emergence from the underground press scene and gauges its achievements as a catalyst of counterculture rebellion. It surveys mid-70s porn chic and illumes Screw's increasingly lonely crusade for total freedom of sexual expression, covering the court battles in the late 70s and touching on the downfall of Times Square in word and image. Finally, the stunning and total collapse of his business empire and personal life is mapped out in meticulous detail, as is his ascension from the ashes and his run for the presidency in 2008. The movies Al was in over the years, the bizarre spin-off papers he published, such as Mobster Times and Death Magazine, the erratic personal behaviour - it's all here in this readable and lavishly illustrated profile of America's last angry dirty old man.",1900486792,9781900486798,en,2011-12-15 00:00:00,3.86,7.0,Beneath Contempt And Happy To Be There : The Fighting Life of Porn King Al Goldstein,JackStevenson,Television | Television | Biography: General | Biography: Arts & Entertainment | Ethical Issues: Pornography & Obscenity,Paperback,jackstevenson television television biography general biography arts entertainment ethical issues pornography obscenity beneath contempt is a raucous heavily illustrated xrated tale of the amazing life and publishing career of unrepentant porn king al goldstein the selfmade sultan of times square he ruled over this mythic realm of sin and corruption for decades chronicling its forbidden pleasures in the pages of his trailblazing sex paper screw and making them accessible to millions his story is the stuff of the american dream an overweight cab driver and welfare recipient who founded screw and became the most outspoken figurehead of the sex revolution goldstein went on to become a multimillionaire and tireless opponent of all things establishment here was a man who had sex with the worlds most famous porn starlets rubbed elbows with literary lions such as henry miller and phillip roth attended celebrity orgies with the likes of gay talese partied with hugh hefner at the playboy mansion and then lost it all morphing into americas most famous homeless drifter of the new millennium he threw his heart soul and fortune into a series of bruising first amendment battles and became a folk hero to the disgruntled masses giving the finger to the world as exwives drained him and fired exemployees and unwitting targets of his vicious satires who couldnt take a joke sued him cabbies waiters and cops on the beat cheered him when he appeared on the street the al goldstein story stars a cast of thousands of hookers hustlers and porn starlets with key guest parts played by equally colourful characters in addition to getting upcloseandpersonal to goldstein in a way that lends heretofore unavailable detail and context to the story beneath contempt charts screws emergence from the underground press scene and gauges its achievements as a catalyst of counterculture rebellion it surveys mid70s porn chic and illumes screws increasingly lonely crusade for total freedom of sexual expression covering the court battles in the late 70s and touching on the downfall of times square in word and image finally the stunning and total collapse of his business empire and personal life is mapped out in meticulous detail as is his ascension from the ashes and his run for the presidency in 2008 the movies al was in over the years the bizarre spinoff papers he published such as mobster times and death magazine the erratic personal behaviour its all here in this readable and lavishly illustrated profile of americas last angry dirty old man

,"Has Canada moved beyond the nation state into the world of the post-national? To what extent have fixed notions of Canadian nationhood been replaced by a more global, decentralized sense of identification? Is nationhood (or post-nationhood) best expressed by statelessness and exile or by belonging? Or can Canadian national identity in fact fruitfully coexist with the post-national consciousness? These are some of the issues covered by this volume, issues seen from a range of perspectives - literary, cultural, political and economic. In the literary sphere the national/post-national debate is explored both through canonical writers, such as L. M. Montgomery, Stephen Leacock, and Marie-Claire Blais, and through recent First Nations, Asian-Canadian, African-Canadian, Ukrainian-Canadian and Quebec writing. The political and economic range is equally diverse, covering such topics as immigration policy, multiculturalism, Canadian-American relations, tourist imaginings of the Canadian North, the Canadian city, and Quebec nationalism. The book brings together 27 original articles from international scholars and creative writers, offering both European and Canadian perspectives.

599154.0,"Celebrated as a trading port, Hong Kong was also Britains eastern fortress. Likened by many to Gibraltar and Malta, the colony was a vital but vulnerable link in imperial strategy, exposed to a succession of enemies in a turbulent age and a troubled region. This book examines Hong Kongs developing role in the Victorian imperial defence system, the emerging challenges from Russia, France, the United States, Germany, Japan and other powers, and preparations in the years leading up to the Second World War. A detailed chapter offers new interpretations of the Battle of Hong Kong of 1941, when the colony succumbed to the Japanese invasion. The remaining chapters discuss Hong Kongs changing strategic role during the Cold War and the winding down of the military presence. The book not only focuses on policies and events, but also explores the social life of the garrison in Hong Kong, the struggles between military and civil authorities, and relations between the armed forces and civilians in Hong Kong. Drawing on original research in archives around the world, including English, Japanese, and Chinese sources, this is the first full-length study of the defence of Hong Kong from the beginning of the colonial period to the end of British military interests East of Suez in 1970.

And so this 72-year-old physician is appointed state coroner, despite having no training, equipment, experience or even inclination for the job. But the job's not that bad and Siri quickly settles into a routine of studying outdated medical texts, scrounging scarce supplies, and circumnavigating bureaucratic red tape to arrive at justice.

The language under investigation is mostly English, although a few papers deal with French and German, and, to a lesser extent, with Dutch, Polish, Russian and Hebrew. The majority of the contributions focus on the semantics of the definite and indefinite articles, leading into discussions of anaphoricness, specificness, opacity and transparency, referentiality and attributiveness and genericness. The relation of the determiners to other parts of grammar, in particular relativisation and predication, is also investigated. Some attention is also given to quantifiers.

342352.0,"This volume assesses the formidable Special Forces fielded by Italy's navy and air force in World War II. Italian Navy Special Forces were particularly active and respected in the Mediterranean, where 10th Motor-Torpedo Boat Flotilla used frogmen, 'two-man torpedoes' and explosive ram-boats. The Italian Air Force formed a special commando unit, ADRA, before the 1943 surrender; it was tasked with attacking Allied airfields and communications in North Africa.

855012.0,"Miller Plays: 6 is the final volume in Methuen Drama's acclaimed series of work by Arthur Miller who, during his lifetime, was acknowledged as 'the greatest American dramatist of our age' (Evening Standard). Featuring two plays from the 1990s and his final two plays (2002 and 2004), it is the first ever publication of Miller's final play, Finishing the Picture. Inspired by his experience during the filming of The Misfits with his then wife Marilyn Monroe, the play was completed and produced at the Goodman Theatre, Chicago, just months before the playwright's death in Feburary 2005. Broken Glass (1994) is set in Brooklyn in 1938 and intertwines a woman's obsession with the news from Germany that government thugs are smashing Jewish stores, with her strange relationship with her husband.

,"Sediment Acoustics is Dr. Robert D. Stoll's seminal book addressing Biot Theory for the modeling of acoustic behavior of ocean sediments. The book is written for seismic-acousticians in the geo-exploration, engineering, oceanographic and underwater sound communities. Robert Stoll, a respected leader in marine geoacoustics for more than forty years, added a brief preface and selected bibliography to this 2006 second printing of his book, first published in 1989. Sediment Acoustics provides an excellent introduction to Biot Theory, the physics underlying the model parameters, and the experimentally measurable predictions of theory. The book constitutes a major synthesis for non-specialists: the results of laboratory, in-situ and numerical modeling studies of seismic-acoustic wave propagation, reflection and attenuation in two-phase poro-visco-elastic media. The text draws from Dr. Stoll's then-20+ year study of shallow subsea porosity and permeability and their effects on seismic-acoustics over the 5-1500 Hz band and has much to offer those interested in better understanding of the Biot model. It is written at the graduate literature review level but includes enough tutorial sections and references to be useful as a text for new researchers in seismic modeling, quantitative seismic stratigraphy, offshore marine geotechnique, underwater acoustics and sonar, and ground-interacting aeroacoustics.",932146147,9780932146144,en,2016-09-14 00:00:00,4.0,,Topics in Communications Theory,DavidMiddleton,Wave Mechanics (vibration & Acoustics) | Electronics & Communications Engineering | Acoustic & Sound Engineering,Hardback,davidmiddleton wave mechanics vibration acoustics electronics communications engineering acoustic sound engineering sediment acoustics is dr robert d stolls seminal book addressing biot theory for the modeling of acoustic behavior of ocean sediments the book is written for seismicacousticians in the geoexploration engineering oceanographic and underwater sound communities robert stoll a respected leader in marine geoacoustics for more than forty years added a brief preface and selected bibliography to this 2006 second printing of his book first published in 1989 sediment acoustics provides an excellent introduction to biot theory the physics underlying the model parameters and the experimentally measurable predictions of theory the book constitutes a major synthesis for nonspecialists the results of laboratory insitu and numerical modeling studies of seismicacoustic wave propagation reflection and attenuation in twophase poroviscoelastic media the text draws from dr stolls then20 year study of shallow subsea porosity and permeability and their effects on seismicacoustics over the 51500 hz band and has much to offer those interested in better understanding of the biot model it is written at the graduate literature review level but includes enough tutorial sections and references to be useful as a text for new researchers in seismic modeling quantitative seismic stratigraphy offshore marine geotechnique underwater acoustics and sonar and groundinteracting aeroacoustics

,"The objective of this work is to design Proportional Integral Derivative controller using PLC and implement it to control the speed of a DC motor. The modifications of control system have to be done frequently. In order to do so we have to come across lots of complexities. These PLC based systems removes the detailed hardware design considerations. Now PLC offers us an easy technique to modify the wiring of control system without changing its hardware. The speed of a DC motor is controlled here by varying the armature voltage using PLC as discrete state controller. Thus by applying an appropriate ladder logic a PID controller is developed as it has the combined advantages of proportional, integral & derivative control action.

33716.0,"From A to Z, the Penguin Drop Caps series collects 26 unique hardcovers--featuring cover art by Jessica Hische  It all begins with a letter. Fall in love with Penguin Drop Caps, a new series of twenty-six collectible and hardcover editions, each with a type cover showcasing a gorgeously illustrated letter of the alphabet. In a design collaboration between Jessica Hische and Penguin Art Director Paul Buckley, the series features unique cover art by Hische, a superstar in the world of type design and illustration, whose work has appeared everywhere from Tiffany & Co. to Wes Anderson's recent film Moonrise Kingdom to Penguin's own bestsellers Committed and Rules of Civility. With exclusive designs that have never before appeared on Hische's hugely popular Daily Drop Cap blog, the Penguin Drop Caps series launches with six perennial favorites to give as elegant gifts, or to showcase on your own shelves. G is for Golding. At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable tale about ""the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.""",143124293,9780143124290,en,2013-05-09 00:00:00,3.69,2327675.0,Lord of the Flies,WilliamGolding JessicaHische,Contemporary Fiction | Classic Books & Novels,Hardback,williamgolding jessicahische contemporary fiction classic books novels from a to z the penguin drop caps series collects 26 unique hardcoversfeaturing cover art by jessica hische it all begins with a letter fall in love with penguin drop caps a new series of twentysix collectible and hardcover editions each with a type cover showcasing a gorgeously illustrated letter of the alphabet in a design collaboration between jessica hische and penguin art director paul buckley the series features unique cover art by hische a superstar in the world of type design and illustration whose work has appeared everywhere from tiffany co to wes andersons recent film moonrise kingdom to penguins own bestsellers committed and rules of civility with exclusive designs that have never before appeared on hisches hugely popular daily drop cap blog the penguin drop caps series launches with six perennial favorites to give as elegant gifts or to showcase on your own shelves g is for golding at the dawn of the next world war a plane crashes on an uncharted island stranding a group of schoolboys at first with no adult supervision their freedom is something to celebrate this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want anything they attempt to forge their own society failing however in the face of terror sin and evil and as order collapses as strange howls echo in the night as terror begins its reign the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued labeled a parable an allegory a myth a morality tale a parody a political treatise even a vision of the apocalypse lord of the flies is perhaps our most memorable tale about the end of innocence the darkness of mans heart
